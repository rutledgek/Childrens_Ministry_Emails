<h4>Vacation Bible School, July 10-14,</h4>

Remember to register your children and volunteers for VBS. If you are an adult volunteering, make sure to register first, and you will receive the discount code to use on your children's registration.<br><br>
The online registration system helps us to collect the fees and also to be able to create the attendance rosters and check-in sheets when we get to VBS faster.<br><br>
Go to <a href="http://links.covumc.com/vbs">http://links.covumc.com/vbs</a> to watch a  preview video and register children. You can register as a volunteer at <a href="http://links.covumc.com/vbs-volunteer">http://links.covumc.com/vbs-volunteer</a>.
