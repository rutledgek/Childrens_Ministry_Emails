              <p>
                 Peter and John traveled around sharing Jesus’ message with the people they met. They weren’t rich, and they didn’t have any possessions. Instead they depended on the communities they visited to provide their supplies.<br><br>
Daily a man who was lame from birth was carried to the Temple by other people and placed at the Beautiful Gate. He begged for money from the people who were entering to pray. The man’s physical condition made him an outsider, and he wasn’t allowed to enter the Temple to pray.<br><br>
When Peter and John came to pray, the man asked them for money. They told him they didn’t have any money, but they would give him what they did have. Peter said, “In the name of Jesus of Nazareth, stand up and walk!” Healing the man in public was a controversial move, but Peter didn’t hesitate to do God’s work.<Br><br>
The man stood and began walking and leaping, confirming his healing and allowing him to be a part of the community of faith again. He entered the Temple with Peter and John and worshipped with them.<br><br>
Many who saw the miracle believed in Jesus, but the Sadducees were angry with Peter and John for healing in Jesus’ name. They had the disciples put in prison, but they weren’t able to hold them for very long. Too many people in Jerusalem knew what had happened and didn’t understand why Peter and John were arrested.<br><Br>
Peter was concerned about the crowd understanding that healing wasn’t an attribute the disciples cultivated over time. He reminded the people that he healed by the authority of Jesus, “In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.”
