              <p>
                 The culture in Jerusalem had turned against the disciples. Herod and the Sanhedrin had come to agree that Jesus and his followers were detrimental to Israel. James had been arrested and beheaded. Since this pleased the Jews, they decided to arrest Peter, too.<br><br>
Four squads of soldiers were sent to guard Peter. He was bound by two chains, sleeping between two guards, with additional guards posted at every exit. Since he was scheduled to suffr the same fate as James the next day, the situation seemed hopeless. But the church was gathered, praying for Peter’s deliverance.<br><br>
An angel appeared and tapped Peter’s side to wake him. The angel told him to get up and get going. Peter followed the angel past the guards and through the iron gates of the prison. When he gained his freedom in the city, the angel disappeared. Up to this point, Peter thought he was dreaming. When he realized that it was real, he headed for the house of John Mark’s mother where the church was praying.<br><br>
A servant girl heard Peter knocking on the gate. She was so shocked to see Peter, she forgot to open the door but instead ran to tell the church that Peter was alive. The church rejoiced together when they saw Peter. He fellowshipped with them for a while, then left to go to another place.<br><br>
Herod’s soldiers had no idea what happened to Peter. They were punished because Peter had escaped. But Peter carried on with his ministry and the Word of God continued to advance.

          <h3>RESOLVING TO ENDURE</h3><br>
          <p>Parenting is an endurance test.  Small children will test our patience, older children will test our boundaries, and teenagers and college students will test the limits of our ability to worry.<br><br>
Like any endurance race, we must commit to endure and persevere. Here is an article was written by a parent who did just that.
