It was the first day of the week, three days after Jesus had been buried in a borrowed tomb. But this was the most amazing day in history. The earth shook, the soldiers fell down like dead men, the angel of the Lord appeared and rolled the stone away from the entrance to the tomb.<br><br>
When the sun was coming up, Mary Magdalene and Mary came to the tomb bringing spices to treat Jesus body. (Would the soldiers let them see Jesus’ body? How would they remove the stone?) When they reached the tomb, it was empty—Jesus’ body was not there.<br><Br>
The angel of the Lord spoke to them and told them Jesus was not there because he was risen! Then the angel commanded them to go and tell the disciples that Jesus would meet them in Galilee. On their way to the disciples, the women met Jesus. He had his resurrected body, but he wasn’t a ghost. They took hold of his feet and worshipped him.<br><br>
The women were the first to witness the empty tomb, the first to tell the good news that Jesus was alive, and the first to see the resurrected Jesus. True to his word, Jesus appeared to the disciples to teach them about the Resurrection and send them out to serve.
