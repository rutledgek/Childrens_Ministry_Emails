              <p>
                 Cornelius, a Roman centurion in Caesarea, prayed to God faithfully. His outstanding character and his generous gift to the poor were a memorial to God. Even though he was a Gentile, he was well respected by the Jewish community. God responded to Cornelius’s faithfulness by sending him a vision. An angel from the Lord told him to send his men to Joppa to fid Peter.<br><br>
As the men’s journey brought them close to Joppa, Peter went up on the roof to pray. God sent him a vision of a white sheet full of animals being lowered down from heaven. The Lord instructed Peter to get up, kill, and eat one of the animals. Peter, who had always followed the Jewish dietary laws, refused to follow God’s command. God told him, “Never consider unclean what God has made pure.”<br><br>
Peter’s vision wasn’t about food, but about his mission to fulfil God’s purpose that unclean (uncircumcised) Gentiles would share Israel’s blessings. So Peter went with the men to Caesarea to meet Cornelius. They shared their visions with each other and discussed what they meant. Peter said to Cornelius, “God has shown me that I should not call anyone unclean.”<br><br>
Peter and Cornelius realized that a religious revolution was about to commence in Israel. Peter took Jesus’ message to the Gentiles because God had shown him that God shows no partiality. God’s love is for everyone.

          <h3>THREE MEALTIME QUESTIONS THAT CHANGE EVERYTHING (INCLUDING THE QUALITY OF YOUR FOOD)</h3><br>
          <p>Family mealtime is becoming a lost art.  As we choose to fill our family's and children's schedules with activity after activity, we are choosing to cut other things. Unfortunately, the one we chose most often is a family meal around the table.
<br><Br>
In the process, we are giving up the chance to listen and learn about what our children are going through each day, we are losing the art of storytelling that gives the broader story to each of our lives, and we are missing an opportunity to shape the happenings of daily life into faith-building moments.
<br><br>
I hope you will reclaim the dinner table, and in the process use these questions to help strengthen your family.
