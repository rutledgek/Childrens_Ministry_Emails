Family mealtime is becoming a lost art.  As we choose to fill our family's and children's schedules with activity after activity, we are choosing to cut other things. Unfortunately, the one we chose most often is a family meal around the table.

In the process, we are giving up the chance to listen and learn about what our children are going through each day, we are losing the art of storytelling that gives the broader story to each of our lives, and we are missing an opportunity to shape the happenings of daily life into faith-building moments.

I hope you will reclaim the dinner table, and in the process use these questions to help strengthen your family.
